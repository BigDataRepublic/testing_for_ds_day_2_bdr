# -- Exercise 4 --
# Write a module scoped fixture that yields an instance of DishwasherModel, trained on the labelled data in
# dummy_dishwasher_registration.csv (using get_trainings_data()). Let it depend on the fixture restrict_grid_search().


# -- Exercise 5 --
# Write a test that uses the fixture you just created to test that all predictions on the unlabeled data in
# dummy_dishwasher_registration.csv are positive.
